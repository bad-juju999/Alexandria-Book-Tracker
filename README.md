Description 
---

As an avid reader who constantly lends my books to friends and family, I wanted a central location to store a dynamic list of the books I have read and some brief details about them. Therefore I developed Alexandria, a web app that lets users visually quantify and represent their library no matter where they are in relation to their books. Users are able to sort, filter and delete books they have added to their digital library. Alexandria was developed to assist readers recommend and review books they have previously read.
